🎯 Codeforces Wrapped

Codeforces Wrapped is a web application inspired by Spotify Wrapped, but built for competitive programmers.
It visualizes your Codeforces activity and turns raw stats into a clean, engaging summary of your journey.

Enter your Codeforces handle → get your programming year in review.

🚀 What is this?

If you grind Codeforces, you generate a ton of data — submissions, solved problems, ratings, contests.
Codeforces Wrapped transforms that data into meaningful insights and visuals that help you reflect, improve, and flex a little.

✨ Features

📊 Total solved problems

🧠 Problem difficulty breakdown

🏆 Rating & contest performance overview

⏱️ Submission activity insights

🔥 Personal “grind” statistics

🎨 Clean, modern UI inspired by Wrapped-style storytelling

🛠️ How it works

Enter your Codeforces handle

The app fetches public data using the Codeforces API

Your stats are processed and displayed in a visual, easy-to-understand format

No login. No tracking. Just public data.

🎯 Why I built this

Competitive programming is about consistency and long-term growth.
This project helps you:

reflect on your progress,

stay motivated,

and better understand your strengths and weaknesses.

Also — it’s a fun way to make stats feel human.
